# Calculator

Calculator is an Android application written in Kotlin that allows users to perform mathematical calculations while adhering to the order of operations. It provides functionality to convert infix expressions to prefix and postfix notations, and then evaluates the expressions to determine the correct mathematical precedence.

## Features
- Mathematical Operations: Calculator supports common mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as parentheses for grouping expressions.
- Order of Operations: The application follows the standard order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) when evaluating mathematical expressions, ensuring accurate results.
- Expression Evaluation: The application can evaluate expressions in prefix and postfix notations to determine the correct mathematical precedence and obtain the accurate result.
- User-friendly Interface: The application has a clean and intuitive interface that makes it easy for users to enter and evaluate mathematical expressions.

## Installation
To use Calculator on your Android device, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Calculator repository from GitHub.
2. Open the project in an Android development environment (e.g., Android Studio).
3. Build and run the application on an Android emulator or a physical Android device.


## Usage
Calculator provides a simple and straightforward interface for users to enter and evaluate mathematical expressions. Users can perform the following actions:

- Enter numerical values using the numeric keypad.
- Use the buttons for addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) to perform basic arithmetic operations.
- Use parentheses to group expressions and control the order of operations.
- Press the "Equal" (=) button to evaluate the expression and display the result.
- Use the "Clear" (C) button to clear the input and start a new calculation.

In addition to basic arithmetic operations, Calculator also provides the following additional features:

- Press the "Prefix" button to convert the infix expression to prefix notation.
- Press the "Postfix" button to convert the infix expression to postfix notation.
- Press the "Evaluate Prefix" button to evaluate the expression in prefix notation and display the result.
- Press the "Evaluate Postfix" button to evaluate the expression in postfix notation and display the result.

Note: Calculator does not currently support advanced mathematical functions such as trigonometric or logarithmic functions. (available soon)
